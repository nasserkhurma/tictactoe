 Identify one problem you encountered in this unit (i.e., during the independent project, not before) and describe how you overcame it. This might be fixing a bug, implementing a feature, or understanding a new concept or skill. Include a code snippet along with your explanation? One problem that I encountried during my indpedant project was creating the win variable and function, and as well linking all the files onto the html file. I overcame this by watching videos and exploring codes to learn how to create a win function, after that I asked Mr.Bowman how to link my game and he taught me the basics how, and I was able to implrment that onto my code,<link rel="stylesheet" href="Style.Css"> this is a snippet of my code that I used to link my still css onto my game, const restartBtn = document.querySelector("#restartBtn");
const winConditions = [
    [0, 1, 2],
    [3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8],
    [0, 3, 6],
    [1, 4, 7],
    [2, 5, 8],
    [0, 4, 8],
    [2, 4, 6] 
    This is the code that I created to teach the algorythim the win conditions possbile for a player to win as. 
     
     How has your understanding of computing changed since the beginning of the semester? Identify at least one specific piece of knowledge, concept, or attitude? My understanding of computing has changed darasticaly and my knowledge of comupter science has increases expontentialy, the main core piece of knowledhe that I understabd the most is how an algorythym works, and I learned that you need to be very specefic to the very dot. 
     
     What new skills have you acquired this semester? Identify at least one thing you can do now that you could not do before taking the class? One new skill that I have acquired that I would not be able to do without this class would be to code, I found out how to create a file and use that specefic style of code to create a functional website/game, and without taking this class I would never be able to do so. 
     
     In what ways do computers improve our lives? Explain? Computers enhance our lives by streamlining tasks through automation and providing instant access to vast amounts of information and communication networks. They also enable innovative solutions in fields like healthcare, education, and entertainment, improving overall efficiency and quality of life.
 
 In what ways do computers improve our lives? Explain. Removing computers could reduce screen-induced health issues and foster more face-to-face social interactions and outdoor activities, potentially improving overall well-being.

. Will being in this class have an impact on you in the future? In what way? Yes being in this class will impact my future because I can furhter my understanding of coding and if robots take over the world I could try to use coding to stop them, This class could as well impact my future by helping me create shortcuts in the future when it comes to mathematics and programing.
